</h1>
<div class="his">
<p>Bhilwara is most pioneer city of Rajasthan.</p>

<p>According to substantiation the present Bhilwara city had a mint where coins known as 'BHILADI' were minted and from this denomination was derived the name of the district. Over the years it has emerged out as the small CITY of Rajasthan. Nowadays, Bhilwara is better known as the textile city in the country.
</p><p>
The oldest part of this town was set up in the middle of the 11th century by building a Shiva temple that still exists today and is known as the Bada Mandir or Jataun Ka Mandir. The area that is now known as Purana Bhilwara or Bhilwara Gaon (Patwari Mohalla, Junawas). As per another legend, the city of Bhilwara had a mint that minted coins known as “bhiladi”. This is supposedly the origin of the district’s name. There is also reference to Arjuna having fought here during the Mahabharata period. Historical records show that a town named Mandal close to Bhilwara served as the military base of the Mughals when they had attacked Chittaurgarh. The ruins of their campsite can still be seen today. A watch tower that was built on a small mound in Mandal is now a Devi temple.</p>
